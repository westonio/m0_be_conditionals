# Self Evaluation

1. **When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?** It is useful to use conditionals in code when there are more than one pathways that could/need to be taken. Easy examples are age restrictions, calculating tax to be withheld from a paycheck, determining what to wear.
1. **If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?** If I could do this assignment over, I would take more time to expand on the challenges and take more time to add comments into my code to describe what is happening.
1. **What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?** I was most satisfied about the many built-in methods to be leveraged. I am excited for this because it will help me be more efficient as I continue to learn to code.
